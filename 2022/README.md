My solutions for [Advent Of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in C# 10/.NET 6 to complete all puzzles for 50 ‚≠ê.

## Parameters
```
--all #Run all days

```
If none or invalid parameters are used, the application will calculate the last available puzzle.

## Structure
- Each puzzle is stored in a separate file which can be found with the links below
- Part 1 and 2 are implemented in a single file to share code if possible
  - Each solution file contains a `SolveFirst` method to solve the first part and `SolveSecond` for the second part
- Inputs are stored in `input/` with the files named `01.txt, 02.txt, ...` for each puzzle
  - The input is loaded into an `Input` class which can be accessed as a raw string or line array in each solution class
