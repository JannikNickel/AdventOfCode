# AdventOfCode2019
My solutions for [Advent Of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) in C to complete all puzzles for 50 ‚≠ê.

## Arguments
```
--all #Run all days
--day <number> #Run the puzzle from the selected day
```
If no arguments are used, the application will calculate the last available puzzle.

## Structure
- Each puzzle is stored in a separate file which can be found with the links below
- Part 1 and 2 are implemented in a single `dayX.c` file to share code if possible
  - Each solution contains a `dayx_part1` function to solve the first part and `dayx_part2` for the second part
- Inputs are stored in `input/` with the files named `01.txt, 02.txt, ...` for each puzzle
  - The input is loaded into an input struct (`input.h`) which can be accessed as a raw string or lines in each solution file
