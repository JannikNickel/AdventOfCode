# AdventOfCode2021
My solutions for [Advent Of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) in Rust 1.67.1 to complete all puzzles for 50 ‚≠ê.

## Parameters
```
--all #Run all days
--day <number> #Run the puzzle from the selected day
```
If no parameters are used, the application will calculate the last available puzzle.

## Structure
- Each puzzle is stored in a separate file which can be found with the links below
- Part 1 and 2 are implemented in a single file to share code if possible
  - Each solution source file contains a `run1` method to solve the first part and `run2` for the second part
- Inputs are stored in `input/` with the files named `01.txt, 02.txt, ...` for each puzzle
  - The input is loaded into an `Input` struct which can be accessed as a raw string or line array in each solution
- `common/` contains some modules like data structures which are used in various solutions
