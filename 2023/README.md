# AdventOfCode2023
My solutions for [Advent Of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) in Python 3.12 to complete all puzzles for 50 ‚≠ê.

## Parameters
```
--all #Run all days
--day <number> #Run the puzzle of the selected day
```
If no parameters are used, the application will calculate the last available puzzle.

## Structure
- Each puzzle is solved in a separate file which can be found with the links before (or in the `solutions/` folder)
- Part 1 and 2 are implemented in a single `dayX.py` file to share code if possible
    - Each solution contains a `solve_first` function to solve the first part and `solve_second` for the second part
- Inputs are stored in `input/` with the files named `01.txt, 02.txt, ...` for each puzzle
    - The input is loaded in an input class (`input.py`) which can be accessed as raw string or line list in each solution function
